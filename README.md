# Grid Control
Grid Control is a free and open source alternative to the CAM application from NZXT. Credits for this awesome project go to akej74!

This is a fork to add some new features, first and foremost temperature averaging, in order to reduce fan speed oscillation. I will however send every useful feature upstream to akej74.
